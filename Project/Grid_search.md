# Hyperparameter Optimization with Grid Search

I have applied the **Grid Search** algorithm to find the optimal hyperparameters for the machine learning models.  
The implementation is located in the `Model_ML` module, where the relevant functions include the word **`Optimized`** in their names.  

This ensures that the models are trained with the best combination of hyperparameters, improving their overall performance and accuracy.
